= Starknet Community Development Funds: Guidelines & Rules

Rooted in developer-centric principles, Starknet champions high performance, innovation, creativity, and a strong community spirit. As we transition to the Starknet Foundation, we continue to place great importance on shared knowledge, collective problem-solving, and the irreplaceable value of our community members, especially those driving growth and unity initiatives.

Starknet is dedicated to bolstering community strength, unity, and outreach. As such, we provide financial support to communities working actively towards this shared goal. The funds should ideally be employed in the following areas:

. Provision of grants to community members undertaking projects that align with our philosophy and contribute to our broader objectives.
. Allocation of member education and training resources via online tutorials, webinars, mentorship programs, and more.
. Enhancement and upkeep of open, inclusive communication channels, such as Telegram groups, Discord servers and community forums.
. Promotion of community engagement via incentivized activities like idea contests, art contests, and problem-solving challenges.
. In addition, we are open to other creative initiatives that align with our philosophy and goals. Starknet recognizes that all community members are potential contributors to our mission, and we discourage any attempts to deter participation or collaboration.
